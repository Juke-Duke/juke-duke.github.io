        I was surprised to see how much of the media we consume now is both explicitly based on and inspired by earlier kinds of media, such as paintings, after viewing the "Ways of Seeing" video series. The parts of the videos when the camera would move to a billboard in the city and then switch to a renowned artwork truly demonstrated how much media today draws on earlier works as a basis. It's crucial, in my opinion, to pay attention to instances where current media borrows indirectly from the past while nevertheless frequently using similar themes. I also agreed with him that the camera renders religious symbols essentially worthless since the photos reduce them to mere facts. A lot of people in my community who come from backgrounds where religious pilgrimage is extremely important believe that images like those make pilgrimage feel more approachable and keep that experience at the forefront of your mind as something to strive for. I've never considered that for others who don't share my faith might just see these pictures as information about something they will never see, so that definitely gave me a new perspective on those kinds of images. I observed certain advertisements that depicted groups of people and compared to some older artworks, the models' position placements or the sort of emotion they evoked were comparable.
