        The readings were really intriguing since they dealt with a subject that has interested me as well. The potential for technical development is nearly limitless, and daily fresh discoveries are discovered that occasionally make earlier versions obsolete. One can only speculate as to what will happen because said versions were previously our "high tech." Yet, privatization still constitutes a serious danger, particularly online. Major social networking sites are "walling off" information shared by their members from the rest of the Web, according to Tim Berners-Lee in his essay Long Live the Web. Although I understand what he meant when he said that everyone should have access to everything on the internet in order to learn as effectively as possible, it's obvious that the purposes for the internet have significantly altered since it first went up. Nowadays, individuals choose to share their life with others in private using various phone applications and web-based features. I personally wouldn't want to use some portions of the internet if it meant that anyone could see what I was doing or looking at, and I don't want to contribute to anyone else's educational process.
